How can we be sure that it's totally okay to get the data from the website? Open [<strong>`its robots.txt site`</strong>](https://idx.co.id/robots.txt) and see the following result:

```
Server Error

404 - File or directory not found.
The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.
```

It doesn't seem that they care whether or not we scrape their data. üòÉ
